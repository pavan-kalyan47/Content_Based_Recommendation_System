# Content-Based Recommendation
#### Content-based systems analyze the attributes of items (e.g., movies) and recommend items with similar features to the userâ€™s preferences. The system assumes that users will like items that are similar to ones they have already enjoyed.

# Key features used:

#### Genres: Categorical data representing movie genres.
#### Tags: User-generated keywords describing movies.
#### Ratings: Numerical data capturing user ratings for movies.

# Non-KNN Approach
#### This method uses a direct similarity computation between movies:

### a. Feature Extraction
#### Genres: Transformed into a structured format where each genre is treated as a binary feature (present or absent for a movie).
#### Tags: Processed using text vectorization techniques like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), which assigns weights to words based on their importance in describing a movie.
### b. Similarity Calculation
Cosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two feature vectors. Higher similarity values indicate that two movies are closely related in terms of their features.
### c. Recommendation
#### Find the most similar movies by sorting similarity scores and selecting the top matches.

# KNN-Based Approach
#### This method uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to recommend movies.

### a. Feature Preparation
#### The same features (genres, tags, ratings) are extracted and processed as in the non-KNN approach.
#### Additionally, numerical features like ratings are scaled to ensure uniformity across all features.
### b. KNN Algorithm
#### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): An unsupervised learning algorithm that identifies the k closest neighbors to a given movie based on a chosen similarity metric (e.g., cosine distance).
#### The model is trained on the feature matrix, enabling it to quickly find similar movies for a given input.
### c. Recommendation
#### Retrieving the k most similar movies from the trained KNN model.
